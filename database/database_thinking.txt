vs.


mydoc.probe__name_#


what are advantages?  Hierarchy allows unplanned relationships because of the way things are grouped. Is this true? Non-hierarchical does, too.
	
Need docs and doc files

Big question: what is database structure? Hierarchical or not?


Experiment_reference   

Need hierarchical viewing for the user, underlying database structure doesn't matter

Experiment / 
	Probe/
		Probe_Name_#/
			metadata
			applicationname_data/
				

	animal/
		animal_1/
			animal_1_metadata




	neuron/
		Probe_Name_#/
			(itemized list)
			Neuron Doc is an NSD_EPOCHSET, maybe an NSD_PROBE_TIMESERIES

	region/
		Region Doc is an NSD_EPOCHSET, maybe an NSD_PROBE_TIMESERIES
		Probe_name_#




Question: how to do the following


Suppose we have only 1 animal in the experiment
	I would like that to mean that all probes are related to THAT animal, even if there is no explicit representation
	But if you searched, how would you find all probes that were related to that animal? The database has to know it
