# NDI

NDI (Neuroscience Data Interface) is a means for specifying and accessing neuroscience data regardless of the format of the files or the organization of the files and data on disk. It allows the creation of analysis code that is invariant to data format and organization, so the analysis process can be independent of the raw format. NDI also includes a database for storing analyses, and analyses of analyses, etc. NDI allows an Application ecospace where individual applications can read raw data and read from the database, and write their results back to the database in a human-readable and machine-readable manner.

A mature prototype of NDI is available in [Matlab](https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDI-matlab) and a version for Python is well under construction.
