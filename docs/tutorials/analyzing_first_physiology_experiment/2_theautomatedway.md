# Analyzing your first electrophysiology experiment with NDI

This is planned tutorial that will cover

1. reading and plotting raw data (provided);
2. using a spike-sorting app to identify neurons from raw voltage recordings;
3. analyzing stimulus-responses using built-in tuning curve apps; 
4. plotting the responses in documents in the database.
