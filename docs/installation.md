3. Run the following in Matlab: 

    `cd ~/Desktop`

    `ndi_install`

## Required Matlab toolboxes

To use all of the NDI tools, the following Matlab toolboxes are required:

| Toolbox | Toolbox | Toolbox |
| -- | -- | -- |
| MATLAB | Simulink | Control System Toolbox |
| Curve Fitting Toolbox | Image Processing Toolbox | Optimization Toolbox |
| Signal Processing Toolbox | Simscape | Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox |

You can use the `ver` command in Matlab to see which toolboxes you have installed.
